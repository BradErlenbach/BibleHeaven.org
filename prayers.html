        <h3>The Prayer of St. Benedict</h3>
        <p>O holy Father Benedict, blessed by God both in grace and in name, who, while standing in prayer, <br>
            with
            hands raised to heaven, didst most happily yield thy angelic spirit into the hands <br>
            of thy Creator,
            and hast promised zealously to defend against all the snares of the enemy <br>
            in the last struggle of
            death those who shall daily remind thee of thy glorious departure and <br>
            heavenly joys; protect me, I
            beseech thee, O glorious Father, this day and every day, by thy <br>
            holy blessings, that I may never be
            separated from our dear Lord, from the society of thyself, <br>
            and of all the blessed. <br>
            Through the same
            Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
